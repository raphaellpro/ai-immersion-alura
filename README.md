# AI Immersion 2nd Edition - Alura & Google

This repository contains the projects and learnings developed during the **AI Immersion 2nd Edition**, an initiative by Alura in partnership with Google.

Alura's AI Immersion 2nd Edition offered a practical journey into the universe of Generative Artificial Intelligence, focusing on Google's tools. Over five lessons, we explored everything from the fundamentals of Gemini and Google AI Studio to creating practical applications like chatbots and semantic search systems.

## Course Content

### Lesson 1: Diving into Gemini, Google's AI
Introduced Gemini, Google's artificial intelligence, and the concepts of generative AI. Students learned to generate various types of content, such as tables, poems, and code, and were also introduced to Google AI Studio and its image analysis capabilities.

### Lesson 2: Best techniques in Prompt Engineering
Focused on improving interaction with AI through prompt engineering. Techniques such as zero-shot, few-shot, and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting were explored, using Google AI Studio to create marketing campaigns and generate code more effectively.

### Lesson 3: Exploring Google AI Studio parameters
Delved into the different types of prompts (chat, freeform, and structured) and the configuration parameters of Google AI Studio. The concepts of tokens and Natural Language Processing (NLP) were addressed, with a practical introduction to Python in Google Colab for interacting with AI.

### Lesson 4: Creating your own chatbot with the Gemini API in Google Colab
Participants got hands-on experience developing a custom chatbot. Using the Gemini API in the Google Colab environment, they learned to build a conversational AI application.

### Lesson 5: Creating a document search system using embeddings and the Gemini API
The final lesson covered the creation of a semantic search system for documents. It taught how to use embeddings to represent information and how to enable a Large Language Model (LLM) to access and understand documents through the Gemini API and Google Colab.
